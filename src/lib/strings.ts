/**
 * Centralized user-facing copy.
 *
 * Phase 1 ships a single hardcoded language (English) — there is deliberately no
 * i18n library, no locale routing and no language switcher in V1 (30-day solo
 * constraint). See `01-01-SUMMARY.md` § "Copy language decision".
 *
 * Strings live here rather than inline in JSX so that a later i18n pass is a
 * clean extraction (this object becomes the `en` message catalogue) instead of a
 * rewrite of every component. Rules:
 *
 *   - One namespace per user-facing surface, named after its route.
 *   - Never inline a user-facing literal in a component; add it here first.
 *   - Copy must satisfy the voice contract in `01-UI-SPEC.md` § Copywriting
 *     Contract: direct, second person, no exclamation marks, no "Oops", no emoji.
 *
 * Later plans extend this file: `signup` (01-07), `storeNotFound` (01-05),
 * `storefront` (01-05). Do not pre-populate a namespace before its surface exists.
 *
 * Note: this governs UI copy language only. Currency and number formatting stay
 * on the `fr-CM` locale (`Intl.NumberFormat('fr-CM', { currency: 'XAF' })`) per
 * CLAUDE.md — that is a Cameroon formatting convention, independent of copy
 * language.
