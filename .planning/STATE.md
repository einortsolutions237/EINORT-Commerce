# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-16)

**Core value:** A merchant picks an industry, adds a logo and a few products, and within minutes has a storefront that looks like it cost them money to build.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Multi-Tenant Foundations & Domain Resolution

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Multi-tenant foundations (Phase 1) and dashboard-session tenant resolution (TEN-04, deferred to Phase 2) are split because session-based resolution has no dashboard/auth to resolve against until Phase 2 exists.
- Roadmap: Full onboarding (ONB-02/03/04) deferred to Phase 4 alongside the theme/template system, since a "live, branded storefront" cannot exist until the flagship template and Theme→Page→Section→Block system are built — Phase 1 only covers bare signup + subdomain provisioning.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Order/Payment-Claim State Machine): MTN MoMo / Orange Money USSD merchant-code strings need re-verification against official Cameroon operator merchant docs before build (flagged MEDIUM confidence in research).
- Phase 4 (Theme/Section/Block System): design-distinctiveness has no objective completion signal — the side-by-side "would a stranger think these are the same product" check must be built into this phase's definition of done explicitly.
