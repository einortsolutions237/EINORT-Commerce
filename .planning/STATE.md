# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-16)

**Core value:** A merchant picks an industry, adds a logo and a few products, and within minutes has a storefront that looks like it cost them money to build.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — product-catalog-order-payment-claim-state-machine

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (product-catalog-order-payment-claim-state-machine) — EXECUTING
Status: Waves 1-5 complete and merged to master (03-01 through 03-15, 15/16 plans — all content plans done). Only Wave 6 (03-16, the phase gate: full suite + requirement-coverage test + blocking human walkthrough) remains. Phase 3's own completion gate (verifier + code-review + phase.complete) has not yet run — will fire once Wave 6 lands.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Multi-tenant foundations (Phase 1) and dashboard-session tenant resolution (TEN-04, deferred to Phase 2) are split because session-based resolution has no dashboard/auth to resolve against until Phase 2 exists.
- Roadmap: Full onboarding (ONB-02/03/04) deferred to Phase 4 alongside the theme/template system, since a "live, branded storefront" cannot exist until the flagship template and Theme→Page→Section→Block system are built — Phase 1 only covers bare signup + subdomain provisioning.
- [Phase 02-06]: beforeAddMember omitted (verified against crud-members.mjs/crud-org.mjs that membershipLimit already gates add-member and org creation never calls membershipLimit)
- [Phase 02-06]: beforeUpdateOrganization refuses any incoming slug rather than validating it, pending Phase 4's real rename flow (StoreSlugHistory, invalidateTenantHost)
- [Phase 02-06]: beforeDeleteOrganization refuses unconditionally; remove-member/update-member-role/leave left deliberately ungated (T-02-37, accepted)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Phase 3: MTN MoMo / Orange Money USSD merchant-code strings need re-verification~~ — **Resolved 2026-08-23** by `03-RESEARCH.md`'s "Payment Rails: the D-15 Blocker, Resolved" section, sourced directly from MTN Cameroon's and Orange Cameroun's own official documentation (HIGH confidence). Neither operator publishes a one-shot parametrized P2P string; both require an operator-issued merchant code for a parametrized tap-to-dial link. Manual-copy ships unconditionally as the floor regardless of merchant-code availability.
- Phase 4 (Theme/Section/Block System): design-distinctiveness has no objective completion signal — the side-by-side "would a stranger think these are the same product" check must be built into this phase's definition of done explicitly.
- Phase 2 (Merchant Auth, Entitlements & Trial): automated decision-coverage gate reported 0/13 CONTEXT.md decisions (D-01–D-13) cited in plan `must_haves`/`truths` frontmatter — overridden and proceeded to execute-phase on 2026-08-17. The plan-checker's independent semantic review confirmed all 13 decisions have implementing tasks; manual grep confirmed D-04–D-09/10, D-12 are cited by ID in task `<action>` bodies (just not in the scanned frontmatter fields). D-01/D-02/D-03 are only cited as a range ("D-01 through D-05"); D-11 and D-13 have no ID citation found anywhere. Re-verify these five during Phase 2's verify-phase pass. **Still open as of 2026-08-30** — a cross-phase GSD skill audit confirmed no `02-VERIFICATION.md` was ever produced (Phases 1 and 2 were merged wave-by-wave without ever reaching `gsd-execute-phase`'s own verifier/code-review/`phase.complete` gate). Queued to close via `gsd-execute-phase 2` as part of the post-Phase-3 retroactive audit pass (alongside `gsd-secure-phase` and `gsd-code-review --depth=deep` on Phases 1-3).
