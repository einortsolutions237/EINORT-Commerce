# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-16)

**Core value:** A merchant picks an industry, adds a logo and a few products, and within minutes has a storefront that looks like it cost them money to build.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — merchant-auth-entitlements-trial

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Multi-tenant foundations (Phase 1) and dashboard-session tenant resolution (TEN-04, deferred to Phase 2) are split because session-based resolution has no dashboard/auth to resolve against until Phase 2 exists.
- Roadmap: Full onboarding (ONB-02/03/04) deferred to Phase 4 alongside the theme/template system, since a "live, branded storefront" cannot exist until the flagship template and Theme→Page→Section→Block system are built — Phase 1 only covers bare signup + subdomain provisioning.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Order/Payment-Claim State Machine): MTN MoMo / Orange Money USSD merchant-code strings need re-verification against official Cameroon operator merchant docs before build (flagged MEDIUM confidence in research).
- Phase 4 (Theme/Section/Block System): design-distinctiveness has no objective completion signal — the side-by-side "would a stranger think these are the same product" check must be built into this phase's definition of done explicitly.
- Phase 2 (Merchant Auth, Entitlements & Trial): automated decision-coverage gate reported 0/13 CONTEXT.md decisions (D-01–D-13) cited in plan `must_haves`/`truths` frontmatter — overridden and proceeded to execute-phase on 2026-08-17. The plan-checker's independent semantic review confirmed all 13 decisions have implementing tasks; manual grep confirmed D-04–D-09/10, D-12 are cited by ID in task `<action>` bodies (just not in the scanned frontmatter fields). D-01/D-02/D-03 are only cited as a range ("D-01 through D-05"); D-11 and D-13 have no ID citation found anywhere. Re-verify these five during Phase 2's verify-phase pass.
